# Config

A few config files and scripts for archlinux.

The setup I used was Archlinux with Xterm and Bash, but I will try to make most
of those scripts usable for the most configuration possible.

As of now, most scripts will not run for you without modifications (Hardcoded
path for example), but an effort will be made to make them more
portable/configurable.

I also use a few scripts not written by me, those will not be present on this
repository and I'll most likely add links to those later.
